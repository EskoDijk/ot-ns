# OpenThread Network Simulator 2

OpenThread Network Simulator 2 (OTNS2) simulates Thread networks using OpenThread POSIX instances
and provides visualization and management of those simulated networks.

Note: this is a fork of the [OpenThread OTNS project](https://github.com/openthread/ot-ns), made by 
[IoTconsultancy.nl](https://www.iotconsultancy.nl/). It offers additional features including:

* Support for more accurate RF simulation of OpenThread nodes. This uses the OpenThread platform 
  `ot-rfsim`, which specifically supports RF simulation, for OT nodes. This C code is included.
* Selectable radio (RF propagation) models with tunable RF parameters.
* Tunable radio parameters on each individual OT node. For example, CSL parameters or Rx sensitivity.
* Control of logging display from OT-node, using `log` and `watch` CLI commands. Logging to file per 
  OT-node. The logging output can include all enabled OT-node log items.
* Detailed logging options for RF operations (at log-level 'trace') performed in the simulated radio,
  at 1 us resolution.
* Animations with duration scaled to the actual time duration of a packet in flight (at low simulation 
  speed only).
* Support for easily adding various node types (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4 Border Router)
* New graphical displays for overall node type statistics, and energy usage (beta - 
  contribution by [Vinggui](https://github.com/Vinggui)).
* Extensive set of Python scripts for unit testing, examples, and case studies.
* Various UI look & feel improvements.
